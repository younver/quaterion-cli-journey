# Motivation
Quaterion designed as a framework rather than a library since it has it’s own dataset, dataloader, caching, trainable model, similarity model and so on. After the model saved by a user, it’s bit complex for other users to use that model. 

For users of Quaterion, it would be useful to have such template and a command line interface (CLI) that allows for easy creation of that project template, and integration with Qdrant. This would make it easier to create new projects, perform experiments, and move from experimentation to deployment. Additionally, it would enable reproducible research, reusable and shareable work, and a faster way from experiment to deployment.
